# Task 2: ERC-20 Token Implementation

## Token Details
Name: SugainaToken  
Symbol: SGT  
Decimals: 18  
Initial Supply: 1000 tokens

## Tools Used
- Solidity
- Remix IDE (Remix VM)

## Description
This project implements an ERC-20 style token using Solidity. The smart contract includes standard token functionalities such as transfer, approve, allowance, and transferFrom. The total token supply is assigned to the deployer during contract deployment.

## Steps Performed
1. Created the MyToken smart contract in Solidity.
2. Compiled the contract successfully using Remix.
3. Deployed the contract in the Remix VM environment with an initial supply of 1000 tokens.
4. Verified the deployer’s token balance using the balanceOf function.

## Result
The ERC-20 token was deployed successfully, and the total supply was correctly assigned to the deployer account.
